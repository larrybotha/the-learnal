## General Interest

Caloric restriction has had [poor reinforcement from
studies](http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/29/want-to-live-longer-dont-try-caloric-restriction/) in its efficacy.

Only 350 different types of cell exist in the human body, via [Nine Months That
Made You](http://www.pbs.org/program/nine-months-that-made-you/).

## Programming

Checking the `currentSrc` property when an `img` fires a load event will reveal
a `pirctures`s current element, while the `src` property will always show the
default attribute provided directly to the `img` tag (in Chrome 51 at least);

[Devtool](https://github.com/Jam3/devtool) is great for debugging gulp tasks:
```shell
$ devtool $(which gulp) -c -- watch:tests
```
